## Password Generator

# Instructions

The program will ask:
```
How many letters would you like in your password?
```
```
How many symbols would you like in your password?
```
```
How many numbers would you like in your password?
```
The objective is to take the inputs from the user to these questions and then generate a random password.

And every time you generate a password, the positions of the symbols, numbers, and letters are different.
